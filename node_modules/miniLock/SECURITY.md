##How to report security issues
Any security issue, regardless of severity, should be reported via full disclosure. Please open an issue on the GitHub tracker. If you are uncomfortable opening an issue on our GitHub tracker, please send an email to `nadim@nadim.computer`.

##Communication expectations
Depending on the severity of the security issue, response times will vary. Medium to severe security issues are almost guaranteed a same-day response.
